Reflecting the latest versions of the JavaScript standard, the book offers well-proven techniques and best practices you’ll rely on for years to come.</p>\n<p>Effective JavaScript is organized around 68 proven approaches for writing better JavaScript, backed by concrete examples. You’ll learn how to choose the right programming style for each project, manage unanticipated problems, and work more successfully with every facet of JavaScript programming from data structures to concurrency. Key features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better ways to use prototype-based object-oriented programming</li>\n<li>Subtleties and solutions for working with arrays and dictionary objects</li>\n<li>Precise and practical explanations of JavaScript’s functions and variable scoping semantics</li>\n<li>Useful JavaScript programming patterns and idioms, such as options objects and method chaining</li>\n<li>In-depth guidance on using JavaScript’s unique &quot;run-to-completion&quot; approach to concurrency</li>\n</ul>\n",
